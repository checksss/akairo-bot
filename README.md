### Tags
The tags system is an easy-to-use set of commands that allows users to create their own 'tags', which act like custom commands. Tags are useful for storing information about a guild or paragraph-style messages that you only want to type once. The tags are sharable across members of the same guild, but not different guilds.

Tags also support message attachments, like pictures, videos, audio files, and other files. The content of the tags is the solely the property of the tag's creator. The tags are stored safely in a database, and aren't viewed by me.

## Plans
* Add a music streaming system
* Add fun, simple games like fishing, slots, or blackjack
* Add more moderation tools
* Add feature and bug reporting
* Add auto-moderation (invite and token filtering, message logging, profanity filtering, and an auto kick/ban system)

## Status
Akairo Bot is up almost 100% of the time and numerous updates to performance and to add new features are implemented daily.
